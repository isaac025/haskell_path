# Haskell Mastery
This is a repository containing:
1. intro: data structures, algorithms, functional programming specific (SICP,
   Purely Functional Data Structures, Introduction to Functional Programming
   through the Lambda Calculus)

2. advanced: programming languages, compilers, interpreters 

3. master: Software Engineering

# Goal
The goal of this repository is learn Haskell by applying all topics covered
here in order to develop better practices before implementing for the Real
World. Here is a quote from Esdger Dijkstra that inspired me to do so:
> Programming is one of the most difficult branches of applied mathematics; the
> poorer mathematicians had better remain pure mathematicians.
