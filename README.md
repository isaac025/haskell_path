# Haskell Mastery
This is a repository containing:
1. computer science topics (from basics to
advanced), like [data strcutures](./ds/), [algorithms](./algo), etc.

2. software engineering practices like [Algebra-Driven
Design](./software_eng/add), [programming structure](./software_eng/sicp) 

3. functional programming specifics like [monads](./monads) 

***all implemented in Haskell**.

# Goal
The goal of this repository is learn Haskell by applying all topics covered
here in order to develop better practices before implementing for the Real
World. Here is a quote from Esdger Dijkstra that inspired me to do so:
> Programming is one of the most difficult branches of applied mathematics; the
> poorer mathematicians had better remain pure mathematicians.
