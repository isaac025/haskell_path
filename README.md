# Haskell Mastery
The purpose of this repo is to relearn everything about computer science but in
Haskell (Functional Programming).

## Contents
The following are the main repositories:

1. novice: Introduction to Functional Programming through the Lambda Calculus, 
           The Haskell Road To Logic, Math & Programming, Cracking the Coding
           Interview.

2. apprentice: Structure & Interpretation of Computer Programs, Book of Monads

3. adept: Purely Functional Data Structures, The Art Of Computer Programming (1-3)

4. expert: Algebra Driven Design, Software Abstractions: Logic, Language, and Analysis, 
           Haskell in Depth, 

5. master: Crafting Interpreters, Compilers: Principles, Techniques, & Tools, 
           Assemblers and Loaders,
             

6. legendary: Model Checking, Structured Computer Organization, 
              Operating Systems: Design and Implementation.

# Goal
The goal of this repository is learn Haskell by applying all topics covered
here in order to develop better practices before implementing for the Real
World. Here is a quote from Esdger Dijkstra that inspired me to do so:
> Programming is one of the most difficult branches of applied mathematics; the
> poorer mathematicians had better remain pure mathematicians.
